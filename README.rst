============
CHECKHASHGUI
============
A tool to compare the hash of a file with the official hash of the file.

I've taken a fork of my work to my heart and start from there. My thanks to tunedal for the update to Python 3.

How to use:

1. Browse to the downloaded file you want to check.
2. Copy the official hash from the download page to the input/output window.
3. Click on "Check".
4. The computed hash is computed and compared to the hash you entered. Both hashes are displayed, as well as the result of the comparison.

NB Result is presented in Swedish, but you'll understand the OK if the checksums where the same.
