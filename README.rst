============
CHECKHASHGUI
============
A tool to compare the hash of a file to the official hash of the file.

I've taken a fork of my work to my heart and start from there.

Per Tunedal

How to use:

1. Browse to the downloaded file you want to check.
2. Copy the official hash from the download page to the input/output window.
3. Click on "Check".
4. The computed hash is computed and compared to the hash you entered. Both hashes are displayed, as well as the result of the comparison.

NB Result is presented in Swedish, but you'll understand the OK if the checksums where the same.
